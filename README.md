Today, the same content can be seen on different sized devices; HD TV, a laptop, a watch, a smartphone. You can imagine the content should adapt for each device. So how? A code-base for each platform? Duplicating the code for each version of the same website?

### The solution to make it all reponsive, YAY!
With Media Queries, we can tell the navigator : if the size of the screen is X, use these css properties, otherwise those. The expected UX result is something like this :

### What did we needed to do?

1. Color change when the display is getting smaller or bigger
2. Hide the elements when the display is getting smaller or bigger
3. Adapting the size of the display when it gets bigger or smaller
4. Re-arrange the divs we made
